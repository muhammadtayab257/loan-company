              would like to borrow for, and how many loan repayments you would
              like to make in that time. You can choose to repay your loan early
              if you can afford to, and youâll only be charged interest for the
              days youâve borrowed, plus a Â£10 early settlement fee (subject to
              the 100% cost of credit cap). Now thatâs total flexibility that

              Weâve seen just how many payday loan companies do not provide
              flexibility with repayments. Instead, their customers commit to
              large one-off payments at the end of the month which may not be
              affordable. As a result, we have developed quick easy loans that
              provide you with the option of making smaller weekly, fortnightly
              or monthly repayments. This means our fast loans will always be
              affordable for you, so just choose the repayment term you need of
              up to 8 months as a new customer, and weâll do the rest.

        customer subject to credit and affordability checks first. Through our
        affordability assessments we will need to evidence that the loan will be
        affordable and sustainable for you. If we cannot determine whether the
        loan will be affordable, we will have to decline your application.

                  Although all applications for quick money loans, along with
                  individual circumstances, are considered, we have put in place
                  screening processes to assess all customersâ creditworthiness.
                  These will include using Credit Reference Agencies (CRAs) and
                  Open Banking Providers where necessary. This is so we can
                  ensure that you can afford the fast loans you request without
                  being in any prior financial difficulty. This forms part of
                  our decision process, and we will still consider your
                  circumstances to ensure your best interests are met..
